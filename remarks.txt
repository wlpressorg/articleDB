The article parser operates in 3 stages:
1. Webget - fetches the article page 
2. Parser - extracts meta tags and content elements
3. Interpreter - refines the article properties

Features:
- Webget
  > follows HTTP redirects automatically, even handles short links 
    (e.g. from Twitter)
  > supports SSL, chunked transfers and gzip encoding
  > exception handling for invalid URLs, timeouts, HTTP status errors

- Parser
  > raw extraction from DOM model
  > handles virtually any character encoding, converts to UTF8
  > extracts meta keywords

- Interpreter
  > best case match for title, publication date, keywords etc.
  > tries to optimize the title, e.g. "foo corge bar" instead of
    "foo corge bar | World news | The Guardian"

Safety precautions/Spam protection
- IP blacklist
- domain blacklist (to exclude unwanted article sources)


Firefox Add-On
==============
The Add-On is quite simple but serves its purpose. The installer adds a 
button to the address bar. A click on this button opens the submission 
form on a new tab and submits the current url to it.

The button gets disabled on non-http pages (local pages, ftp etc.) and 
also within the domain wikileaks-press.org (since it makes no sense to 
submit your own pages to your database). This also means that the button 
is disabled on the submission page itself (which is currently not the 
case since the test page is outside your domain).

The Add-On comes without installer dialogue, welcome page, preferences 
dialogue, context menu items or any other flashy details. If you miss 
something, feel free to add it. Please keep in mind that add-ons often 
have lots of compatibility issues. The more features you add the higher 
is the risk to get in trouble. Thus, I recommend to keep the add-on as 
simple as possible.
